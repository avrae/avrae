Avrae is a Discord bot designed to help you and your friends play D&D online.

You can join the Avrae Development Discord [here](https://support.avrae.io), and invite Avrae to your own
Discord server [here](https://invite.avrae.io)!

## Key Features

### Advanced Dice Roller
With a custom dice parser, Avrae is one of the most advanced dice rollers on Discord, capable of supporting pretty much 
every type of roll needed to play D&D. Advantage, disadvantage, and crits are built in, you can keep, drop, or reroll 
dice as needed, dice can explode, and dice can be bounded.

Want to use the dice roller in your own code? Check out [the code](https://github.com/avrae/d20)!

### Character Sheet Integration
Avrae can read character sheets from D&D Beyond, Dicecloud, or a Google Sheet, automatically generating macros to roll 
attacks, ability checks, and saving throws. A player can then simply use a command to make a check, save, attack, or 
cast, and all necessary rolls will be resolved automatically.

### Initiative Tracking
The initiative tracker is a fast way to track combat in a text channel. It supports automatic combatant sorting, HP, 
AC, resistance, and status effect tracking, and integration with the character sheet manager and 5e content to further 
streamline combat.

### Moddability
Have a feature in mind that isn't already in Avrae? Avrae provides a fully-featured modding API to write your own
commands, and a place to share them with the community!

[Alias Workshop](https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop)!

### How to run Avrae locally
#### Using Docker (Recommended)

Check out [docker/readme.md](docker/readme.md).

#### Building Manually
##### OS Requirements
Avrae is built on Ubuntu, but should be fully compatible with any UNIX-based system.
It is possible to run Avrae on Windows, but is not recommended.

##### Creating Support Files
You'll need to create a Google Drive Service Account. You can find instructions on how to do this [here](https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html#using-signed-credentials).

Follow steps 1-3 in the **Signed Credentials** portion. Rename the JSON `avrae-google.json` and put it in the project root.

#### Dependencies
###### Redis
You will need to run a Redis instance to serve as a high-performance cache. Download [Redis](https://redis.io/download) and run a redis server locally **before** launching Avrae.

###### MongoDB
You will also need to run a MongoDB instance to serve as Avrae's database.

###### Python
Avrae requires Python >= 3.8.0.

Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

##### Environment Variables
These are the required/recommended environment variables for local dev.

- `ENVIRONMENT` - "development" for development
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` - a valid Discord bot token
- `DISCORD_OWNER_USER_ID` - your Discord user ID
- `MONGO_URL` - a MongoDB connection string (defaults to `mongodb://localhost:27017`)
- `REDIS_URL` - a Redis connection string (defaults to `redis://redis:6379/0`)
- `NO_DICECLOUD` - if set, disables dicecloud connection/importing, otherwise:
    - `DICECLOUD_USER` - a dicecloud username
    - `DICECLOUD_PASS` - the password for the dicecloud user
    - `DICECLOUD_TOKEN` - a dicecloud API token

##### Running

- If running Avrae in unsharded mode (**recommended for testing**), run `python dbot.py test`.
- If running Avrae in sharded mode, run `python dbot.py`.

#### Testing
To test Avrae, run these commands:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.ci.yml -p avrae up -d --build
docker logs -f avrae_tests_1
```
This should initialize an ephemeral database to run command unit tests in. 
You should set the `DICECLOUD_USER`, `DICECLOUD_PASS`, `DICECLOUD_TOKEN`, and `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` env vars to their correct values.

Once tests complete, it is recommended to clean up the containers with `docker-compose down`.

- `NUM_CLUSTERS` - equal to the number of ECS tasks running Avrae
- `DDB_AUTH_SECRET` - JWT signing secret for DDB auth request
- `DDB_AUTH_WATERDEEP_SECRET` - JWT signing secret for DDB auth response
- `DDB_AUTH_AUDIENCE` - JWT audience (default `"avrae.io"`)
- `DDB_AUTH_ISSUER` - JWT issuer (default `"dndbeyond.com"`)
- `DDB_AUTH_EXPIRY_SECONDS` - JWT expiry (default 5m)
