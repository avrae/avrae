            Avrae is a useful tool, and, as such, even has support for automating rolls done by monsters, inside of and outside of combat. In this tutorial, we will go over some of the basic commands that a DM can use to help run monsters effectively. Even if you're a player, knowing these commands can be useful, in case you ever want to run a game of your own.

            If you have your D&D Beyond account linked, you can use [your unlocked monsters](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters?utm_source=avrae&utm_medium=reference) here in Avrae, too. See the D&D Beyond Link tutorial for more information.

            First, let's run a check for a monster. After that, try a save for a monster. These are both similar to how they would be run as a player.
            
            As an example, to make a Sleight of Hand check for a Commoner, you would use  `{ctx.prefix}moncheck Commoner "Sleight of Hand"`. To have that same Commoner roll a Dexterity saving throw, you would use `{ctx.prefix}monsave Commoner Dexterity`. Try it yourself!
            ```
            {ctx.prefix}moncheck <name of monster> <skill>
            {ctx.prefix}monsave <name of monster> <ability>

            For example, doing `{ctx.prefix}monattack "Silver Dragon Wyrmling" list` would list off the attacks of a Silver Dragon Wyrmling. Try that!

            Superb! Keep in mind that, like with monster attacks, monster spells will not automatically deal damage to your players' characters. To do that, you must be using the initiative tracker, which is covered in the Initiative (DM) section of the tutorial.

            Like with the previous commands, when casting using a monster with multiple words in its name or using a spell with multiple words in its name, you should surround the argument in quotes. Also, you can also use `{ctx.prefix}mcast` as shorthand for `{ctx.prefix}moncast`, providing you use all the proper arguments in their proper places.
            
            All of the commands covered in this tutorial have in-depth `{ctx.prefix}help` entries for them which list off more in-depth and specific arguments for each command. To view these help entries, use `{ctx.prefix}help moncheck`, `{ctx.prefix}help monsave`, `{ctx.prefix}help monattack`, or `{ctx.prefix}help moncast`, respectively.
            
            One final note. While it was touched upon before, you should know that, as a DM, you cannot change or alter your players' stats in any way (such as modifying their HP or spell slots) without using the initiative tracker. You can learn more about the initiative tracker and how to use it by viewing the "Initiative (DM)" tutorial.
