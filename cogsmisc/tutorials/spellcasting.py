You must also have the ability to cast that spell, such as having it be in your spell list, and have a spell slot of the appropriate level.

            To have that character, for example, cast the cantrip Ray of Frost, you would use `{ctx.prefix}cast "Ray of Frost"`. Try casting one of your own spells!

            Sometimes, a spell just might not have enough "oomph" for the specific situation you need it for. If said spell supports it, however, you can cast that spell using a higher level slot. To do so, you must, as before, be on a character with the ability to cast spells, have that spell on your character's spell list, and have a spell slot of the appropriate level. Not all spells have greater effects when upcasting, though, so be sure to read a spell's description for an "At Higher Levels" section to see if it does.

            For example, if your Fighter has thought it would be a good idea to touch lava, you can upcast Cure Wounds to heal their injuries (but not their pride) by doing `{ctx.prefix}cast "Cure Wounds" -l 4`. The `-l` argument is the key here, as it denotes that you're trying to cast a spell at a higher `l`evel. Try it now!
            ```
            {ctx.prefix}cast <name of spell> -l <slot level>

            When casting most spells, you will have to select a target, or designate multiple targets. Whether friend, foe, or self, Avrae has got you covered.

            In order to target a creature with a spell, you must be playing on a character that can cast spells, have the spell that they're trying to cast in their known spells, and have a spell slot of that spell's appropriate level. While you can target creatures outside of initiative using the following command, know that the automation of healing and damage will not play out unless you are in initiative.
            
            Why don't we first try casting a spell that normally only has one target? For example, Chill Touch. In this specific example, you would use `{ctx.prefix}cast "Chill Touch" -t "Adult Blue Dragon"`. Note the `-t` argument! Try it yourself.
            ```
            {ctx.prefix}cast <name of spell> -t <name of target>

            Marvellous! If you're ever looking to target more than one creature with the same spell, you can use multiple `-t <name of target>` arguments. For example, `{ctx.prefix}cast "Mass Healing Word" -t "Samric Alestorm" -t "Alanna Holimion" -t "Arwyn Terra"`. And, as before, the best results happen when you surround arguments with multiple words in quotes.

            Typically, through normal play, spell slots are gained when resting, or lost when casting. However, there may come a time when you need to manually adjust the amount of spell slots you currently have, such as if you mistakenly cast a spell. To note, these commands can only be used on characters that have spell slots. You also cannot go under the minimum or over the maximum amount of spell slots that your character has for that respective level.

            For example, if you accidentally cast Fireball when you meant to cast Fire Bolt and need that third level spell slot, you can manually regain it by using `{ctx.prefix}game spellslot 3 +1`. Try to manually lose, and then regain, a spell slot now!
            ```
            {ctx.prefix}game spellslot <level of spell slot> -<number of spell slots>
