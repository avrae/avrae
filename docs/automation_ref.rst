Automation Reference
====================

This page details the structure of Avrae's Automation system, the backbone behind custom spells and attacks.

Basic Structure
---------------
An automation run is made up of a list of *effects*. See below for what each effect does.

All Automation runs provide the following variables:

- ``caster`` (:class:`~aliasing.api.statblock.AliasStatBlock`) The character, combatant, or monster who is running the automation.
- ``targets`` (list of :class:`~aliasing.api.statblock.AliasStatBlock`, :class:`str`, or None) A list of combatants targeted by this automation (i.e. the ``-t`` argument).

Target
------
.. code-block:: typescript

    {
        type: "target";
        target: "all"|"each"|int|"self";
        effects: Effect[];
    }

A Target effect should only show up as a top-level effect.
It designates what creatures to affect.

.. attribute:: target

    - ``"all"``: Affects all targets (usually save spells)
    - ``"each"``: Affects each target (usually attack spells)
    - ``int``: Affects the Nth target (1-indexed)
    - ``"self"``: Affects the caster

.. attribute:: effects

    A list of effects that each targeted creature will be subject to.

**Variables**

- ``target`` (:class:`~aliasing.api.statblock.AliasStatBlock`) The current target.
- ``targetIteration`` (:class:`int`) If running multiple iterations (i.e. ``-rr``), the current iteration (1-indexed).

Attack
------
.. code-block:: typescript

    {
        type: "attack";
        hit: Effect[];
        miss: Effect[];
        attackBonus?: IntExpression;
    }

An Attack effect makes an attack roll against a targeted creature.
It must be inside a Target effect.

.. attribute:: hit

     A list of effects to execute on a hit.

.. attribute:: miss

     A list of effects to execute on a miss.

.. attribute:: attackBonus

     *optional* - An IntExpression that details what attack bonus to use (defaults to caster's spell attack mod).

**Variables**

- ``lastAttackDidHit`` (:class:`bool`) Whether the attack hit.
- ``lastAttackDidCrit`` (:class:`bool`) If the attack hit, whether it crit.
- ``lastAttackRollTotal`` (:class:`int`) The result of the last to-hit roll (0 if no roll was made).
- ``lastAttackNaturalRoll`` (:class:`int`) The natural roll of the last to-hit roll (e.g. `10` in `1d20 (10) + 5 = 15`;
  0 if no roll was made).

Save
----
.. code-block:: typescript

    {
        type: "save";
        stat: "str"|"dex"|"con"|"int"|"wis"|"cha";
        fail: Effect[];
        success: Effect[];
        dc?: IntExpression;
    }

A Save effect forces a targeted creature to make a saving throw.
It must be inside a Target effect.

.. attribute:: stat

     The type of saving throw.

.. attribute:: fail

     A list of effects to execute on a failed save.

.. attribute:: success

     A list of effects to execute on a successful save.

**Variables**

- ``lastSaveDidPass`` (:class:`bool`) Whether the target passed the save.
- ``lastSaveDC`` (:class:`int`) The DC of the last save roll.
- ``lastSaveRollTotal`` (:class:`int`) The result of the last save roll (0 if no roll was made).
- ``lastSaveNaturalRoll`` (:class:`int`) The natural roll of the last save roll (e.g. `10` in `1d20 (10) + 5 = 15`;
  0 if no roll was made).

Damage
------
.. code-block:: typescript

    {
        type: "damage";

Set Variable
------------
.. versionadded:: 2.7.0

.. code-block:: typescript

    {
        type: "variable";
        name: string;
        value: IntExpression;
        higher?: {int: IntExpression};

.. attribute:: higher

     *optional* - What to set the variable to instead when a spell is cast at a higher level.

.. attribute:: onError

     *optional* - If provided, what to set the variable to if the normal value would throw an error.

Condition
---------
.. versionadded:: 2.7.0

.. code-block:: typescript

    {
        type: "condition";
        condition: IntExpression;
        onTrue: Effect[];
        onFalse: Effect[];
        errorBehaviour?: "true" | "false" | "both" | "neither" | "raise";
    }

Run certain effects if a special condition is met, or other effects otherwise.

.. attribute:: condition

     The condition to check.

.. attribute:: onTrue

     The effects to run if ``condition`` is ``True`` or any non-zero value.

.. attribute:: onFalse

     The effects to run if ``condition`` is ``False`` or ``0``.

.. attribute:: errorBehaviour

     How to behave if the condition raises an error:

    - ``"true"``: Run the ``onTrue`` effects.
    - ``"false"``: Run the ``onFalse`` effects. (*default*)
    - ``"both"``: Run both the ``onTrue`` and ``onFalse`` effects, in that order.
    - ``"neither"``: Skip this effect.
    - ``"raise"``: Raise the error and halt execution.

Use Counter
-----------
.. versionadded:: 2.10.0

.. code-block:: typescript

    {
        type: "counter";
        counter: string | SpellSlotReference | AbilityReference;
        amount: IntExpression;
        allowOverflow?: boolean;
        errorBehaviour?: null | "warn" | "raise";
    }

Uses a number of charges of the given counter, and displays the remaining amount and delta.

.. note::
    Regardless of the current target, this effect will always use the *caster's* counter/spell slots!

.. attribute:: counter

    The name of the counter to use (case-sensitive, full match only), or a reference to a spell slot
    (see :ref:`SpellSlotReference`).

.. attribute:: amount

     The number of charges to use. If negative, will add charges instead of using them.

.. attribute:: allowOverflow

     *optional, default False* - If False, attempting to overflow/underflow a counter (i.e. use more charges than
     available or add charges exceeding max) will error instead of clipping to bounds.

.. attribute:: errorBehaviour

     *optional, default "warn"* - How to behave if modifying the counter raises an error:

    - ``null``: All errors are silently consumed.
    - ``"warn"``: Automation will continue to run, and any errors will appear in the output. (*default*)
    - ``"raise"``: Raise the error and halt execution.

    Some, but not all, possible error conditions are:

    - The target does not have counters (e.g. they are a monster)
    - The counter does not exist
    - ``allowOverflow`` is false and the new value is out of bounds

**Variables**

- ``lastCounterName`` (:class:`str`) The name of the last used counter. If it was a spell slot, the level of the slot (safe to cast to int, i.e. ``int(lastCounterName)``). (``None`` on error).
- ``lastCounterRemaining`` (:class:`int`) The remaining charges of the last used counter (0 on error).
- ``lastCounterUsedAmount`` (:class:`int`) The amount of the counter successfully used.
- ``lastCounterRequestedAmount`` (:class:`int`) The amount of the counter requested to be used (i.e. the amount
  specified by automation or requested by ``-amt``, regardless of the presence of the ``-i`` arg).

.. _SpellSlotReference:

SpellSlotReference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: typescript

    {
        slot: number;
    }

.. attribute:: slot

    The level of the spell slot to reference (``[1..9]``).

.. _AbilityReference:

AbilityReference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: typescript

    {
        id: number;
        typeId: number;
    }

In most cases, an ``AbilityReference`` should not be constructed manually; use the Automation editor to select an
ability instead. A list of valid abilities can be retrieved from the API at ``/gamedata/limiteduse``.

.. note::
    The Automation Engine will make a best effort at discovering the appropriate counter to use for the
    given ability - in most cases this won't affect the chosen counter, but in some cases, it may
    lead to some unexpected behaviour. Some examples of counter discovery include:

    - Choosing ``Channel Divinity (Paladin)`` may discover a counter granted by the Cleric's Channel Divinity feature
    - Choosing ``Breath Weapon (Gold)`` may discover a counter for a breath weapon of a different color
    - Choosing ``Sorcery Points (Sorcerer)`` may discover a counter granted by the Metamagic Adept feat

.. attribute:: id

    The ID of the ability referenced.

.. attribute:: typeId

    The DDB entity type ID of the ability referenced.

Cast Spell
----------
.. versionadded:: 2.11.0

.. code-block:: typescript

    {
        type: "spell";
        id: int;
        level?: int;
        dc?: IntExpression;
        attackBonus?: IntExpression;
        castingMod?: IntExpression;
    }

Executes the given spell's automation as if it were immediately cast. Does not use a spell
slot to cast the spell. Can only be used at the root of automation. Cannot be used inside a spell's automation.

This is usually used in features that cast spells using alternate resources (i.e. Use Counter, Cast Spell).

.. attribute:: id

    The DDB entity id of the spell to cast. Use the ``/gamedata/spells`` API endpoint to retrieve a list of valid IDs.

.. attribute:: level

    *optional* - The (slot) level to cast the spell at.

.. attribute:: dc

    *optional* - The saving throw DC to use when casting the spell. If not provided, defaults to the caster's default
    spellcasting DC (or any DC specified in the spell automation).

.. attribute:: attackBonus

    *optional* - The spell attack bonus to use when casting the spell. If not provided, defaults to the caster's
    default spell attack bonus (or any attack bonus specified in the spell automation).

.. attribute:: castingMod

    *optional* - The spellcasting modifier to use when casting the spell. If not provided, defaults to the caster's
    default spellcasting modifier.

**Variables**

No variables are exposed.

AnnotatedString
---------------
An AnnotatedString is a string that can access saved variables.
To access a variable, surround the name in brackets (e.g. ``{damage}``).
Available variables include:

- implicit variables from Effects (see relevant effect for a list of variables it provides)
- any defined in a ``Roll`` or ``Set Variable`` effect
- all variables from the :ref:`cvar-table`

This will replace the bracketed portion with the value of the meta variable.

To perform math inside an AnnotatedString, surround the formula with two curly braces
(e.g. ``{{floor(dexterityMod+spell)}}``).

IntExpression
-------------
An IntExpression is similar to an AnnotatedString in its ability to use variables and functions. However, it has the
following differences:

- Curly braces around the expression are not required
- An IntExpression can only contain one expression
- The result of an IntExpression must be an integer.

These are valid IntExpressions:

- ``8 + proficiencyBonus + dexterityMod``
- ``12``
- ``floor(level / 2)``

These are *not* valid IntExpressions:

- ``1d8``
- ``DC {8 + proficiencyBonus + dexterityMod}``

      }
    ]

Area Draining Effect
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
