D&D Beyond Content Integration
==============================

With the release of Avrae 2.0, users can now Link their Discord and D&D Beyond Accounts. Here are some things that you might want to know.

How do I link my D&D Beyond and Discord accounts?
-------------------------------------------------

You can link your accounts on the `Accounts <https://www.dndbeyond.com/account>`_ page on D&D Beyond.

.. note::
    It may take up to 15 minutes for Avrae to recognize the link.

To check the status, use ``!ddb`` to show your D&D Beyond account link.

.. code-block:: text

    !ddb

Linking your accounts gives you the following benefits:

Content Access
--------------
After your accounts are linked, you will be able to access any content you have purchased on D&D Beyond.

.. note::
    If you are in a campaign with content sharing enabled you will also have access to content shared with you.

Private Character Import
------------------------
Linking your D&D Beyond and Discord accounts lets Avrae import your characters from D&D Beyond without having to
make the character sheet public.

Dice Sync
---------
If your DM links your D&D Beyond campaign with a Discord channel using the ``!campaign`` command, any dice you roll
on your character sheet or in the D&D Beyond Player App will show up in Discord in real time!

Also, any checks, saves, or attacks you roll in the linked Discord channel will appear on your character sheet and
the Player App in real time!


Where can I go if I have issues or Questions?
----------------------------------------------
The `Avrae Development Discord <https://support.avrae.io>`_ is a great place to ask questions and get help where
