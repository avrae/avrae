Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n`Spell Save DC = 8 + Charisma modifier + Proficiency Bonus`\n`Spell Attack Bonus = Charisma modifier + Proficiency Bonus`\n**Ritual Casting**: You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.\n**Spellcasting Focus**: You can use a musical instrument (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells."
